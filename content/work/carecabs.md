A live project with a short timescale to create a logo along with letterheads and business cards for a startup.

 >CareCabs is a new business that transports and cares for elderly patients travelling to and from their medical appointments. The brief was open so I made a logomark that portrayed the layered care and protection that comes with company's service. The choice of colour was a reference to the pink uniforms that many care nurses wear. It is also a trusting and warming colour that patients will hopefully respond to and feel comfortable with. Finally the logo also intends to give a sense of motion, as one of the company's main services is safe transport.
