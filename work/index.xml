      <description>&lt;p&gt;A live project with a short timescale to create a logo along with letterheads and business cards for a startup.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CareCabs is a new business that transports and cares for elderly patients travelling to and from their medical appointments. The brief was open so I made a logomark that portrayed the layered care and protection that comes with company&amp;rsquo;s service. The choice of colour was a reference to the pink uniforms that many care nurses wear. It is also a trusting and warming colour that patients will hopefully respond to and feel comfortable with. Finally the logo also intends to give a sense of motion, as one of the company&amp;rsquo;s main services is safe transport.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
